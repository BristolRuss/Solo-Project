## Welcome to my Ping Pong App!

This app is being hosted [here:](https://bristolruss.github.io/Solo-Project/)

If you would like to download a copy and run this locally please follow these instructions:

1) Click on the green "Clone or download" button at the top right of this section.
2) Either download a zipped copy of the files or clone this repo using your prefered cloning method. For this guide I shall be closing using SSH.
3) Browse to the directory you wish to install in your terminal and run `"git clone https://bristolruss.github.io/Solo-Project/ X"` <- X here is what you would like the folder that will be created to be called
4) Once it has finished cloning, cd into this new directory and run ### `npm install` on your terminal. I am using NPM but other package managers are available. 
5) After this has finished downloading all of the dependencies (this can take a while) run ### `npm start` in your terminal. After a few seconds the game should load in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
6) Enjoy

## Intructions 

The App should be fairly intuitive. It is a Ping Pong tournament designed for 8 players.
In the settings `Winning Score` is how many points is required for a player to win each game. `Alternate Server Every` determines how often the serving mechanic should switch.
